{"caption": "Controversial: Digital art isn't 'real' art. Agree or disagree?", "image_prompt": "A powerful, contrasting image. On one side, a traditional painter with a brush and palette, surrounded by oil paints and canvases. On the other, a digital artist intensely focused on a glowing tablet, creating intricate artwork with a stylus. Both figures are equally passionate and skilled, highlighting the debate. Artistic, thought-provoking."}
{"caption": "Fact: There's enough DNA in your body to stretch to Pluto and back 17 times. Unbelievable?", "image_prompt": "An abstract, fantastical representation of a single, shimmering strand of DNA stretching out from Earth through the solar system, past planets like Jupiter and Saturn, eventually reaching a distant, glowing Pluto, and then looping back, implying immense length. Cosmic, scientific wonder."}
{"caption": "Would you rather have a device that predicts the future or one that changes the past?", "image_prompt": "A split image. Left side: A person looking intently at a futuristic device displaying holographic projections of future events (e.g., a news headline from tomorrow, a weather forecast). Right side: The same person holding a different device, with shimmering distortions in the background, subtly changing a historical image or scene (e.g., a famous historical figure appearing slightly different). Enigmatic, thought-provoking."}
{"caption": "Controversial: Automation will create more jobs than it destroys. Your opinion?", "image_prompt": "A complex, dynamic image. On one side, robotic arms efficiently performing manufacturing tasks, creating new, futuristic products, with human oversight in a control room. On the other, humans in collaboration with AI, working on creative problem-solving or developing new technologies. Suggests evolution, not destruction. Optimistic, industrial yet intellectual."}
{"caption": "Fact: We've only explored about 5% of Earth's oceans. What lies beneath?", "image_prompt": "A breathtaking, mysterious underwater scene. A tiny, glowing submersible or diver light piercing through the absolute darkness of the deep ocean, revealing faint, colossal silhouettes of unknown sea creatures in the distance, hinting at vast, unexplored depths. Eerie, awe-inspiring."}
{"caption": "Would you rather master every language instantly or master every musical instrument instantly?", "image_prompt": "A split image. Left side: A person effortlessly speaking to diverse groups of people from different cultures, surrounded by speech bubbles with various languages. Right side: The same person expertly playing a multitude of musical instruments simultaneously or seamlessly transitioning between string, wind, and percussion instruments, surrounded by harmonious notes. Joyful, skill-based."}
